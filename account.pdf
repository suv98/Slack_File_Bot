A bank statement is a summary of transactions over a period. It includes the account owner’s name, account number, charges, deposits, withdrawals and deductions. Lenders like EarlySalary require users to submit a bank account statement in PDF form to apply for personal loans or instant cash loans. 

If an account holder uses internet banking, the process of acquiring a PDF account statement is simple. Regardless of which bank a user is associated with, the process of obtaining a PDF account statement is pretty much the same. Here’s the method to get an account statement: 

Visit the bank’s Internet Banking website.
Log in to your net banking account with your username and password. You can register for an Online banking account in case you already don’t have one. 
Click on ‘Bank account statement’, ‘Download e-Document’ or ‘View your transaction history’. 
Select the date range required.
Click on ‘Download PDF’. Some banks do not have a download option, in which case, you have to select the print option and then save it as a PDF. 
Here’s the other important information you must know about PDF account statements:

Bank statements are emailed in a password-protected PDF format by default. If you can’t find it on your registered email, you can sign up to receive these periodical emails.
These statements are almost always in protected PDF format and don’t require any additional sign-up or information. However, make sure to include the password or decrypt the file before uploading it.
Additionally, banks also offer account statements in a zip format and as a CSV spreadsheet. Unfortunately, however, almost none of the online banking or financial services accept these. Some direct links to obtain a PDF account statement from popular banks are given below.
